# Welcome to Bitcoin Search

## Features

- **Elasticsearch Integration**: Directly interfaces with Elasticsearch, leveraging the dataset curated and indexed by the [scraper](https://github.com/bitcoinsearch/scraper). This integration facilitates robust full-text search capabilities, supporting complex queries, filters (authors, domains), and sorting options.
- **URL-Driven Search State**: Manages the search state through URL parameters using NextJS's router, enabling shareable search URLs and intuitive user navigation.
- **Proxy Server for Security**: Implements a [server-side proxy layer](src/pages/api/elasticSearchProxy/search.ts) for Elasticsearch queries, abstracting away direct access to the Elasticsearch cluster and enriching queries with necessary filters and parameters.

## Getting started

The search engine is built using NextJS and connects to elasticsearch
